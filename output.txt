I would like to start by apologizing if I inflict a lot of emotions in this post. But I am currently in a very bad state. For the past Thanksgiving week, I have been working entirely on my project 3. Last Monday (11/20), I discussed with my project partner about splitting the workload for project 3B and 3C. The discussion results were that I will be working on UI Behavior (a, w, s, d) and HUD display for part B and the secondary feature for part C. He would be working on saving loading and interacting with the input string for part B and the primary feature for part C. I truly trusted him, as he did complete his work for part A World Generation. On Friday (11/24), we had a call to check each other progress. At that time, he told me that he had completed his part for 3B: save and load and interacting with the input string. But when I checked the code he pushed on Saturday (11/25), I realized that he did not pay attention to the specs and did everything wrong. So, I called him that night (11/25), and he promised me that he would not "let me down" and that he would get it done by yesterday (11/26). Since I knew he would not have time to work on his part for Project 3C, Primary Feature, I spent my Sunday finishing implementing the entire 3C, primary and secondary features. Yesterday (11/26), I messaged him and asked when he could call, as I needed to know how his progress was with "interacting with the input string." He replied to the message saying that he could call later and vanished. From yesterday night till today, I called him and texted him many times, and he has not replied. I am so tired right now. I need to complete Project 3B and 3C all by myself. I can\'t get it done by today. Can I request a 2-day extension, as this is an extenuating circumstance?

I have submitted an Extenuating Circumstances Extension, I hope that I can have a longer extension or some other solutions.
The full story:	After we\'re assigned to the same group, we had a zoom meeting (since she can\'t meet in person at all) on November 15, where we agreed that I will work on the logic behind the rooms first and she will work on main.java first but since then all she did was a few lines of code about parsing the seed. After spending several days working on the project, I finished the code for project 3A all by myself at that time but there are several problems and bugs. On Saturday morning (the extended due date) she agreed to take over the rest of 3A (debugging) and will submit it before the deadline. But she didn\'t do anything. I started texting and calling her that night but she didn\'t reply to me at all. I tried fixing it that night but we ended up not being able to finish 3A on time. On Sunday, she texted me an apology claiming she has an emergency appointment. Since then, she didn\'t do anything. I spent my entire thanksgiving holiday rewriting 3A and started on 3B. Meanwhile, She did not work on any part of the project or reach out to me at all. Then, this afternoon, while I was at office hour struggling on the project she sent me this text after vanishing for a week:	"Hi, Due to unforeseen circumstances/family-related emergencies, I\'m unsure if I can continue with the project or course now. I have advised the TA about this matter. I sincerely apologize for the short notice and any convenience this may have caused. Thank you, and good luck".	All the details I described above can be backed up by the github records and our texts.
I have spent the majority of all my day over the past 10 days working on this project alone and yet is not close to finishing it because I\'m working on this alone, without a partner. Therefore, I hope that the deadline can be extended, I hope you can understand the circumstances. 
Even with the extended deadline, I still don\'t know if I can finish it alone because I have been putting all my time and effort working on this project for the past 10 days and there are multiple projects/assignments from other classes that I am now very behind on. Hopefully we can figure out a reasonable solution regarding this whole incident. Thank you so much. I hope you can understand the situation.
', 'document': 'My project partner did not do any part of the project, vanished and sent me a text this afternoon, claiming she\'s "unsure if she\'ll continue this project or course". I have submitted an Extenuating Circumstances Extension, I hope that I can have a longer extension or some other solutions.\n\nThe full story:\nAfter we\'re assigned to the same group, we had a zoom meeting (since she can\'t meet in person at all) on November 15, where we agreed that I will work on the logic behind the rooms first and she will work on main.java first but since then all she did was a few lines of code about parsing the seed. After spending several days working on the project, I finished the code for project 3A all by myself at that time but there are several problems and bugs. On Saturday morning (the extended due date) she agreed to take over the rest of 3A (debugging) and will submit it before the deadline. But she didn\'t do anything. I started texting and calling her that night but she didn\'t reply to me at all. I tried fixing it that night but we ended up not being able to finish 3A on time. On Sunday, she texted me an apology claiming she has an emergency appointment. Since then, she didn\'t do anything. I spent my entire thanksgiving holiday rewriting 3A and started on 3B. Meanwhile, She did not work on any part of the project or reach out to me at all. Then, this afternoon, while I was at office hour struggling on the project she sent me this text after vanishing for a week:\n"Hi, Due to unforeseen circumstances/family-related emergencies, I\'m unsure if I can continue with the project or course now. I have advised the TA about this matter. I sincerely apologize for the short notice and any convenience this may have caused. Thank you, and good luck".\nAll the details I described above can be backed up by the github records and our texts.\n\nI have spent the majority of all my day over the past 10 days working on this project alone and yet is not close to finishing it because I\'m working on this alone, without a partner.

 I wanted to follow up on the recent staff support meetings related to Project2B. After the initial project deadline, the TAs mentioned the possibility of continuing to work on the project to earn additional points. I was able to get a good chunk of points, submitting the updated version on Nov 11. Following this submission, I had another staff support meeting to discuss the points I earned. During this meeting, the TA mentioned that an extension request had been sent to the head TAs for approval. Once approved, they would re-run the autograder for my project. However, it has been more than a week since that discussion, and I have not observed any changes in my grade scope. I was wondering what I should do or if someone could rerun my autograder. Thank you
