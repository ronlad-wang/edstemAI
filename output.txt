Question: 
 Hello,
Beacon currently shows my MT2 score as 0/150, which is different from what I got on Gradescope. Could someone help me get it changed to the correct score?
Thank you!

Answer: 
 I'm sorry to hear about the discrepancy in your MT2 score. However, as an AI assistant, I don't have access to specific student information or the ability to make changes to grades on Beacon or Gradescope. 

I recommend reaching out to your instructor or the course staff directly. They will be able to assist you in resolving the issue and making sure your correct score is reflected. You can send them an email or attend office hours to discuss the matter.

I hope this helps, and good luck in resolving the discrepancy in your MT2 score!

Question: 
 Hello,
I was wondering when will we get a feedback for 3A and when will our 3C checkoff happen as it says our deadline to submit checkoff form for 3C is 30 November?


Answer: 
 The specific dates for receiving feedback on 3A and completing the 3C checkoff will depend on your course schedule and the policies set by your instructor. I recommend checking the course syllabus or reaching out to your instructor or teaching assistant for the specific dates and deadlines for your class. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate information regarding when you can expect feedback on 3A and when you should complete the 3C checkoff.

Question: 
 I already sent an email to the cs61b department about this but I think they did not understand my question. I was working with my partner up until about 4 days ago. He had submitted a Manual Checkoff for project 3a before the due date while we were still working together. The problem is, he dissolved the group very randomly, so I never got a chance to submit a request for a manual checkoff. I was wondering if I can still get a 3a manual checkoff due to my extenuating circumstance. I have had the 3a done since Saturday and I emailed the staff about my problem on the same day.
Thanks.


Answer: 
 I'm sorry to hear about the situation with your partner. Although I'm an AI and cannot assist with specific administrative matters, I can offer some general advice.

In cases like these, it's important to communicate directly with your course staff, such as your instructor or teaching assistants. They are the best ones to address your concerns and provide guidance on how to proceed. Make sure to clearly explain your situation and provide any relevant evidence or documentation (such as your completed 3a assignment).

If you haven't received a response yet, you can try sending a follow-up email or reaching out to them during office hours if available. They may be able to provide you with a solution or offer alternative options.

Remember, it's always best to address these matters directly with your course staff who have the authority to make decisions regarding manual checkoffs and other academic concerns.

Question: 
 <callout type="info">Which discussion(s) are you asking about?</callout>disc 15
did anyone go to this one? ronald's my usual disc homie but i had a presentation so i couldn't make it. there's no worksheet; what did y'all do?


Answer: 
 I apologize for the confusion, but as an AI, I do not have access to real-time information regarding specific discussions at UC Berkeley. I recommend reaching out to your classmates from Disc 15 to inquire about what was discussed in the session. Additionally, you may consider contacting your instructor or teaching assistant for any materials or information that may have been covered in the missed discussion.

Question: 
 I was wondering why I'm losing the BYOW Partnership preference form and 3A reflection points since I filled them out and for the reflection we finished 3a late so we submitted the reflection once we finished. Also even if we're not done do we also submit the 3b and 3c reflection? Also for 2a I submitted late and it's also marked as 0 points.

Answer: 
 I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing issues with your partnership preference form and the reflection points. As an AI, I don't have access to specific student records or personal information. It's best to reach out to your course instructor or teaching assistant directly to address these concerns. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate information and assist you in resolving any issues you may be facing.

Regarding the submission of reflections for assignments 3b and 3c, I recommend checking the course syllabus or assignment guidelines for clarification. Generally, if there is a separate reflection component for each assignment, it is likely expected that you submit a reflection for each part.

For the late submission of assignment 2a, the zero points indicated on the grade report may be due to the late submission policy of the course. Again, I recommend contacting your instructor or teaching assistant to discuss this matter further.

Remember, it's always best to communicate directly with your course staff for personalized support and guidance. They will be able to address your specific concerns and provide accurate information based on your course's policies.

Question: 
 Hi I just wanted to know logistically why a feature would work on our computers with the same git status but not when cloned as described in the spec? There's nothing to change now since its passed the due-date but we wanted to know for the future. 
For further information, when we quit and save then reload our avatar is not where it is left on the cloned version (despite it's location being right in the saved file). But it works everytime on our computers (tested with 20 worlds). 
Thanks!

Answer: 
 There could be a few reasons why a feature might work on your computers but not when cloned or run on another machine. Here are some possible explanations:

1. **Differences in environment:** Even though you and your partner have the same git status, there could be differences in the environment settings, software versions, or dependencies on different machines. These differences may cause the code to behave differently in the cloned version.

2. **Missing or incorrect files:** It is possible that some files are missing or not correctly included in the cloned version. Check that all necessary files, including any assets or saved files, are present in the cloned repository. If a file is missing or incorrect, it could lead to the unexpected behavior you observed.

3. **Relative file paths:** If your code relies on relative file paths, make sure they are correctly specified and compatible with different file systems. Inconsistent file paths can cause issues when running the code on different machines.

4. **External dependencies:** If your code relies on external libraries or modules, make sure they are properly installed or included in the cloned version. Missing or outdated dependencies can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

In general, it's good practice to thoroughly test your code on different machines and environments to ensure consistent behavior. Additionally, consider using a version control system like Git to track changes and ensure that both partners have the same codebase.


Question: 
 My partner has not been communicating and has basically done 0 work throughout the partnership. I have tried communicating with them but they take a very long time to respond and continue to deflect and dodge responsibility. Is this ground for dissolution of the partnership?
Answer: 
 I'm sorry to hear that you're having difficulties with your partner. Based on the information you provided, it seems like you have made a reasonable effort to communicate and collaborate with your partner, but they have not been responsive or productive.

In this case, it might be appropriate to dissolve the partnership. You can fill out the [dissolution form](https://beacon.datastructur.es/dissolution/) and provide details about the lack of communication and contribution from your partner. Include any evidence, such as communication logs or commit history, that can support your case.

The course staff will review your request and make a decision on whether to dissolve the partnership. If the dissolution is approved, you and your partner will no longer work together, and you will be allowed to work individually on the project.

Please remember that dissolving a partnership should be a last resort, and you should first attempt to resolve any issues by communicating with your partner. If you feel uncomfortable, unwelcome, or unsafe in the partnership, please reach out to the course staff for further assistance.
