I would like to start by apologizing if I inflict a lot of emotions in this post. But I am currently in a very bad state. For the past Thanksgiving week, I have been working entirely on my project 3. Last Monday (11/20), I discussed with my project partner about splitting the workload for project 3B and 3C. The discussion results were that I will be working on UI Behavior (a, w, s, d) and HUD display for part B and the secondary feature for part C. He would be working on saving loading and interacting with the input string for part B and the primary feature for part C. I truly trusted him, as he did complete his work for part A World Generation. On Friday (11/24), we had a call to check each other progress. At that time, he told me that he had completed his part for 3B: save and load and interacting with the input string. But when I checked the code he pushed on Saturday (11/25), I realized that he did not pay attention to the specs and did everything wrong. So, I called him that night (11/25), and he promised me that he would not "let me down" and that he would get it done by yesterday (11/26). Since I knew he would not have time to work on his part for Project 3C, Primary Feature, I spent my Sunday finishing implementing the entire 3C, primary and secondary features. Yesterday (11/26), I messaged him and asked when he could call, as I needed to know how his progress was with "interacting with the input string." He replied to the message saying that he could call later and vanished. From yesterday night till today, I called him and texted him many times, and he has not replied. I am so tired right now. I need to complete Project 3B and 3C all by myself. I can\'t get it done by today. Can I request a 2-day extension, as this is an extenuating circumstance?
