This project takes unresolved questions from the CS61B Berkeley EdStem forum and automatically answers them using chatGPT.
It uses the metadata of the question in order to determine what type of question it is and gives GPT the information regarding the assignment if necessary, straight from the 61B course website.

Currently working on a method to access student Githubs to help automatically solve debugging questions
